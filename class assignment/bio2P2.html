			<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>My name is Eduardo Pantaleon. I was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY but I recently moved to Maspeth, Queens. I work in construcion and although I have learned many useful skills and its a great job I would ultimately like to work in a field with one of the two things i love, music or computers. 
				<p>I am currently studying at BMCC. I am a MMP(multi-media programming) major. Although its just the beginning I believe this class has helped me on my decision to what I want to get my bachelors degree in. I am really enjoying learning to write code and it seems to be really straight foward.Before changing my major to this, I wanted to go to 5 Towns College for music production.</p>
				<p>When I have the opportunity to travel somewhere new, I take it. I love being on the road. You can check some of the photos from my recent trips. There are still many places I want to travel to like Vegas, California, Hawaii, Colorado, Europe, Asia and much much more. As I travel to these new locations I will put up pictures of those beautiful areas.</p>
